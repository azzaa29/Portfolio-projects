# Speech-to-Text App

Simple learning project that uses the `openai/whisper-tiny.en` model from
Hugging Face to transcribe audio into text through a Gradio interface.

Main ideas:
- upload an audio file from your browser,
- run speech-to-text using a Whisper model,
- display the transcription in a textbox.
