# Image Captioning

Learning project that uses the `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` model
from Hugging Face to generate captions for images.

It includes:
- a simple script to caption a local image (`image_captioning_cli.py`)
- a small web app built with Gradio to upload an image and get a caption
  (`image_captioning_app.py`)
