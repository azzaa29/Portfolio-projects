# Chatbot App

Simple learning project showing how to build a conversational agent using the
`facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` model from Hugging Face.

Includes:
- a command-line chatbot (`chatbot_cli.py`)
- a minimal API built with Flask (`chatbot_api.py`)

The chatbot keeps a short conversation history and generates replies using a
Seq2Seq model. 
This project was developed as part of the IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate.
